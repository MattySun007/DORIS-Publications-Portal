	<h3>Government Publications</h3>
	<p>
	In 2003, Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed legislation that has brought about a new era in the City Hall Library’s long history of making government information available to the public. “Local Law 11,” as it is called, amended the City Charter to require that all city agencies transmit to the Department of Records, in electronic format, “each report, document, study and publication required by local law, executive order, or mayoral directive to be published, issued, or transmitted to the council or mayor.” Council Member Gale Brewer, chair of the Technology in Government Committee, worked closely with Department staff to spearhead the legislation. Since its passage in 2003, more than 6,000 New York City agency-produced reports and other publications are now quickly and easily accessible via “Mandarin,” the City Hall Library’s automated catalog.
